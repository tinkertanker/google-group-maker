# Navigation Fix for Streamlit App

## Problem
Error: `st.session_state.page_selector cannot be modified after the widget with key page_selector is instantiated`

This occurred when clicking navigation buttons because we were trying to modify a session state key that was already bound to a Streamlit widget (the radio button).

## Root Cause
In Streamlit, once you create a widget with a specific key (like `st.radio(..., key="page_selector")`), you cannot modify that key's value directly in the same script run. The original code was trying to set `st.session_state.page_selector` directly, which is not allowed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated StateManager.navigate_to()
Instead of modifying `page_selector` directly, we now use a separate `next_page` key:

```python
@classmethod
def navigate_to(cls, page: str) -> None:
    # Use a different key for navigation to avoid conflict
    cls.set("next_page", page)
    st.rerun()
```

### 2. Updated Sidebar Navigation Logic
The sidebar now checks for navigation requests and handles them properly:

```python
# Check if navigation was requested
next_page = StateManager.get("next_page")
if next_page:
    # Clear the navigation request
    StateManager.set("next_page", None)
    default_page = next_page
else:
    default_page = StateManager.get("current_page", PAGES[0])

# Page selector widget
page = st.radio(
    "Navigate to:", 
    PAGES, 
    key="page_selector",  # This key is never modified directly
    index=PAGES.index(default_page)
)

# Store current page for next render
StateManager.set("current_page", page)
```

## How It Works

1. When a button clicks to navigate (e.g., "View Members"):
   - `StateManager.navigate_to("ðŸ‘¥ Group Members")` is called
   - This sets `next_page` in session state
   - `st.rerun()` triggers a fresh render

2. On the fresh render:
   - Sidebar detects `next_page` is set
   - Uses it as the default for the radio button
   - Clears `next_page` to prevent loops
   - Radio renders with correct page selected

3. The `page_selector` key is only ever set by the radio widget itself, never modified directly.

## Testing
All navigation paths work correctly:
- Dashboard â†’ Create Group âœ“
- Dashboard â†’ List Groups âœ“
- Dashboard â†’ Settings âœ“
- List Groups â†’ View Members âœ“
- List Groups â†’ Rename âœ“
- List Groups â†’ Delete âœ“
- Create Group â†’ View Members âœ“
- Delete Group â†’ Back to List âœ“

## Key Takeaway
**Never modify a Streamlit widget's key directly in session state.** Always use a separate mechanism for programmatic updates and let the widget manage its own key.
