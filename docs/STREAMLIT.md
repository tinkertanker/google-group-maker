# Google Group Maker - Streamlit Web Interface

A user-friendly web interface for the Google Group Maker CLI tool, built with Streamlit.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Configuration overview and quick actions
- **Create Group**: Create new groups with trainer and member management
- **List Groups**: Browse and search existing groups with action buttons
- **Group Members**: View detailed member lists with role indicators and export options
- **Add Members**: Batch add members via text input or CSV upload
- **Rename Group**: Change group names with preview
- **Delete Group**: Safe deletion with double confirmation
- **Settings**: Configure environment variables and upload credentials

## Prerequisites

Before using the Streamlit interface, ensure you have:

1. **Google Workspace Admin Access**
   - Admin credentials for your Google Workspace domain
   - Permissions to create and manage groups

2. **Service Account Credentials**
   - Service account with Google Admin SDK API access
   - Credentials configured in **Streamlit Secrets** (recommended) or as JSON file
   - See [docs/CREDENTIALS.md](CREDENTIALS.md) for detailed setup instructions

3. **Python Environment**
   - Python 3.6 or higher
   - pip package manager

## Setup

1. **Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Configuration

### Credentials Setup (Streamlit Secrets - Recommended)

The application uses **Streamlit Secrets** for credential management, which works seamlessly in both local development and Streamlit Cloud:

**For Local Development:**
1. Copy the example secrets file: `cp .streamlit/secrets.toml.example .streamlit/secrets.toml`
2. Edit `.streamlit/secrets.toml` with your actual service account credentials
3. The app will automatically load credentials from this file

**For Streamlit Cloud:**
1. Go to your app's Settings ‚Üí Secrets in the Streamlit Cloud dashboard
2. Paste your credentials in TOML format (see Settings page in the app for formatted output)
3. Save and reboot the app

**Legacy JSON File (Optional):**
- You can still use `service-account-credentials.json` for local CLI usage
- The app will fall back to this file if secrets are not configured

For comprehensive credential setup instructions, see [docs/CREDENTIALS.md](CREDENTIALS.md).

### Environment Variables

## Running the Application

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Start the Streamlit app
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## First-Time Setup Checklist

1. ‚úÖ **Configure Credentials**
   - Go to the **‚öôÔ∏è Settings** page
   - Navigate to the "Streamlit Secrets (Recommended)" tab
   - Upload your service account JSON file
   - Click "Save to Local Secrets" (local) or copy TOML for Streamlit Cloud
   - See [docs/CREDENTIALS.md](CREDENTIALS.md) for detailed instructions

2. ‚úÖ **Set Environment Variables**
   - In Settings, configure:
     - `DEFAULT_EMAIL`: Your admin email address
     - `GOOGLE_GROUP_DOMAIN`: Your domain (e.g., `tinkertanker.com`)
     - `ADMIN_EMAIL`: Admin email for API authentication (optional, uses DEFAULT_EMAIL)

3. ‚úÖ **Test Authentication**
   - Click "Test Connection" in Settings
   - Or go to Dashboard and click "Test Authentication"
   - Verify you see a success message

4. ‚úÖ **Create Test Group**
   - Go to "‚ûï Create Group"
   - Create a test group (e.g., `test-group-delete-me`)
   - Verify it appears in "üìã List Groups"
   - Delete it when done testing

## Usage Tips

### Group Names
- Use letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, and periods only
- Can specify full email (e.g., `group@domain.com`) or just name part
- Domain hierarchy: Group email ‚Üí Command line ‚Üí Environment variable ‚Üí Default

### Adding Members
- Supports multiple formats: one per line, comma-separated, semicolon-separated
- Can upload CSV files with an `email` column
- Duplicate emails are automatically removed
- Invalid emails are filtered out

### Batch Operations
- Progress bars show status for long-running operations
- Small delays are built in to respect API rate limits
- Detailed error reporting for failed operations

### Caching
- Group lists and member data are cached for 1 minute
- Use refresh buttons to clear cache and reload
- Cache automatically cleared after modifications

## Security Notes

### Credential Storage

**Streamlit Secrets (Recommended):**
- The `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file is automatically gitignored
- Never committed to version control
- Works seamlessly for both local development and Streamlit Cloud
- Encrypted and secure when deployed to Streamlit Cloud

**For Streamlit Cloud Users:**
- Use the **Secrets UI** in your app settings (Settings ‚Üí Secrets)
- Paste your credentials in TOML format
- Credentials are encrypted at rest and never exposed in logs
- The Settings page in the app provides a formatted TOML snippet you can copy

**Legacy JSON File:**
- The `service-account-credentials.json` file is also gitignored
- Supported for local CLI usage and development
- **Does not work on Streamlit Cloud** (files don't persist)
- If using this method locally, ensure it's never committed to Git

### Best Practices

1. **Never commit credentials** to version control
2. **Use Streamlit Secrets** for cloud deployments
3. **Rotate credentials** regularly via Google Cloud Console
4. **Limit permissions** - only grant necessary API scopes
5. **Monitor usage** - review service account activity periodically

For detailed security guidance, see [docs/CREDENTIALS.md](CREDENTIALS.md).

### Other Security Considerations

- Environment variables are stored in `.env` file (also gitignored)
- All sensitive operations require confirmation
- Debug mode shows detailed error information (use carefully)

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Verify service account has domain-wide delegation
- Check that `DEFAULT_EMAIL` matches your admin account
- Ensure proper OAuth scopes are configured

### Group Operations Fail
- Groups may take time to propagate in Google's system
- Use refresh buttons to reload data
- Check debug logs for detailed error messages

### Performance Issues
- Large group lists may take time to load
- Use search/query filters to limit results
- Consider increasing timeout values if needed

## Development Notes

The web interface is built as a wrapper around the existing CLI tool:

- **config_utils.py**: Environment and credentials management
- **web_utils.py**: API wrapper for CLI commands with parsing
- **streamlit_app.py**: Main application with all pages

The implementation prioritizes safety and user experience while maintaining full compatibility with the existing CLI functionality.
