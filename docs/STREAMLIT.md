# Google Group Maker - Streamlit Web Interface

A user-friendly web interface for the Google Group Maker CLI tool, built with Streamlit.

## Features

- **Dashboard**: Configuration overview and quick actions
- **Create Group**: Create new groups with trainer and member management
- **List Groups**: Browse and search existing groups with action buttons
- **Group Members**: View detailed member lists with role indicators and export options
- **Add Members**: Batch add members via text input or CSV upload
- **Rename Group**: Change group names with preview
- **Delete Group**: Safe deletion with double confirmation
- **Settings**: Configure environment variables and upload credentials

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- Service account with domain-wide delegation for Google Admin SDK
- Proper environment variables configured (see WARP.md)

## Setup

1. **Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configuration**:
   - Set up your `.env` file with required variables (see Settings page in the app)
   - Have your `service-account-credentials.json` file ready

## Running the Application

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Start the Streamlit app
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## First-Time Setup Workflow

1. **Configure Settings**:
   - Go to the "‚öôÔ∏è Settings" page
   - Enter your `DEFAULT_EMAIL` (required)
   - Optionally set `GOOGLE_GROUP_DOMAIN` and `ADMIN_EMAIL`
   - Upload your service account credentials JSON file

2. **Test Authentication**:
   - Use the "üîç Test Connection" button on Settings page
   - Verify authentication is successful

3. **Test with Safe Group**:
   - Create a test group using a safe name like `test-group-delete-me`
   - Add some members and test functionality
   - Delete the test group when done

## Usage Tips

### Group Names
- Use letters, numbers, hyphens, underscores, and periods only
- Can specify full email (e.g., `group@domain.com`) or just name part
- Domain hierarchy: Group email ‚Üí Command line ‚Üí Environment variable ‚Üí Default

### Adding Members
- Supports multiple formats: one per line, comma-separated, semicolon-separated
- Can upload CSV files with an `email` column
- Duplicate emails are automatically removed
- Invalid emails are filtered out

### Batch Operations
- Progress bars show status for long-running operations
- Small delays are built in to respect API rate limits
- Detailed error reporting for failed operations

### Caching
- Group lists and member data are cached for 1 minute
- Use refresh buttons to clear cache and reload
- Cache automatically cleared after modifications

## Security Notes

- Credentials file is saved locally and never committed to git
- Environment variables are stored in `.env` file
- All sensitive operations require confirmation
- Debug mode shows detailed error information (use carefully)

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
- Verify service account has domain-wide delegation
- Check that `DEFAULT_EMAIL` matches your admin account
- Ensure proper OAuth scopes are configured

### Group Operations Fail
- Groups may take time to propagate in Google's system
- Use refresh buttons to reload data
- Check debug logs for detailed error messages

### Performance Issues
- Large group lists may take time to load
- Use search/query filters to limit results
- Consider increasing timeout values if needed

## Development Notes

The web interface is built as a wrapper around the existing CLI tool:

- **config_utils.py**: Environment and credentials management
- **web_utils.py**: API wrapper for CLI commands with parsing
- **streamlit_app.py**: Main application with all pages

The implementation prioritizes safety and user experience while maintaining full compatibility with the existing CLI functionality.
