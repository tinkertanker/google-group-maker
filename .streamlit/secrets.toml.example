# Example Streamlit Secrets Configuration
# =========================================
#
# This file shows the structure for configuring Google Service Account credentials
# in Streamlit secrets. This approach works for both local development and Streamlit Cloud.
#
# SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
#
# For Local Development:
# ----------------------
# 1. Copy this file to .streamlit/secrets.toml
# 2. Fill in your actual service account credentials
# 3. The secrets.toml file is gitignored and will never be committed
#
# For Streamlit Cloud:
# --------------------
# 1. Go to your app dashboard on Streamlit Cloud
# 2. Click Settings (⚙️) → Secrets
# 3. Copy the [google_service_account] section below
# 4. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials
# 5. Paste into the Streamlit Cloud secrets editor
# 6. Save and reboot your app
#
# SECURITY WARNING:
# Never commit the actual secrets.toml file with real credentials!
# Only this .example file should be in version control.

[google_service_account]
type = "service_account"
project_id = "your-project-id"
private_key_id = "your-private-key-id-here"
private_key = """-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
Your actual private key content goes here (multiple lines)
Replace this entire block with your actual private key
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
"""
client_email = "your-service-account@your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
client_id = "your-client-id"
auth_uri = "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth"
token_uri = "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token"
auth_provider_x509_cert_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs"
client_x509_cert_url = "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/your-service-account%40your-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
universe_domain = "googleapis.com"

# Environment Variables Configuration
# ====================================
#
# These environment variables are required for the application to function.
# On Streamlit Cloud, this [env] section REPLACES the .env file (which doesn't persist).
# For local development, you can use this OR a .env file.
#
# Priority: OS environment > Streamlit secrets > .env file

[env]
DEFAULT_EMAIL = "your-email@yourdomain.com"
GOOGLE_GROUP_DOMAIN = "yourdomain.com"
ADMIN_EMAIL = "admin@yourdomain.com"  # Optional, defaults to DEFAULT_EMAIL if not set

# Alternative: Top-level Environment Variables (simpler but less organized)
# ==========================================================================
# If you prefer, you can set these as top-level keys instead of using the [env] section.
# Uncomment the lines below if you want to use this approach:
#
# DEFAULT_EMAIL = "your-email@yourdomain.com"
# GOOGLE_GROUP_DOMAIN = "yourdomain.com"
# ADMIN_EMAIL = "admin@yourdomain.com"

# You can add other Streamlit secrets below if needed for your app
